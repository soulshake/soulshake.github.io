He nearly confessed that he had seen the traffic jam. He withdrew, didn't cry.  A cracked boxer. The two officers were visibly beginning to worry. 

 -- You're sure you don't want to notify anyone?

Michel looked at the woman. Hardly older than his son. He said simply:

-- On the 132. She was driving quickly. 

He added this as evidence ; France always drove fast. Relieved that he finally responds the agent took _plus de place._ She looked at her papers. She knew them by heart, but she took to staring at the words, the figures, to concentrate on something other than the man standing before her. 

-- It wasn't your wife who was driving.

-- But it was her car, added the officer.

The policewoman still scrutinized the report. _Enfin un soutien, du réel à quoi s'accrocher_.

-- a small yellow '94 Mazda Miata, driven by Anouk Charlebois. Someone found the car's papers in your wife's wallet.

Michel didn't have to think long. Anouk, of course, her tennis partner.

-- She had wanted to pass another car and the Mazd Miata was hit by a truck. Your spouse didn't have a chance. She was killed on impact. The driver is alive. I'm not sure if she has regained consciousness.

Michel didn't want any more details. He gestured with his arm, as if he was abandoning the idea of understanding _quoi que ce soit._

-- Where is she?

-- Your wife? At Charles-Lemoyne hospital...

-- We'd like to take you there. The identification...

The policewoman was happy that her colleague had taken the situation into his own hands. She already found searching through her reports tiring.

-- On the subject of madame Charlebois, maybe you could educate us? Do you know who we could reach? If she has any family?

-- I don't know anything.

-- Well, finished the officer, we believed that you knew her quite well.

All this seemed so confusing to Michel that he was looking for his keychain that  he had yet left within reach of his hand.

To let oneself drive, sit on the trap arrière. Since des lunes, he look the place of the driver. Especially since France didn't like to drive. The small streets annoyed her. Highways, on the other hand, allowed her to blow off steam, to catch a good collection of tickets.

And that day, she had not driven. Why?

-- She had amazing breasts.

Had he said it? The two officers didn't react. No, all that took place in his head. His imagination was able to do it, galloped. He believed he had spoken, but he had uttered nothing, not a word. He didn't allow his emotions to show.

However, under his somber carapace, he had become a ball of nerves which no longer knew which side to roll. The chrome ball of a pinball machine, the one which 'gets worked up' at the smallest obstacle, arouses memories, unleashes sounds, turns the figures of the scoreboard, makes the girls in bikinis blink who smiles at the old as if on could believe them. He muddled the game. Tossed about, it rose, fell down, brusquely changed direction, rose again, bounced, allowed itself to be manipulated by the shocks, knowing that, inevitably, it would finish by falling.

-- She had amazing breasts.

The two officers would never hear. They knew nothing about France's breasts. They didn't suspect the importance that they had on his 22 years.
 When he had met this girl, the first thing he had seen, before knowing her name or the sound of her voice, was her breasts. She wasn't yet a bar dancer or an exhibitionist, _bien qu'elle demeurat_, the most impudent person he had known. She lived in a commune. 

And in 1970, after Woodstock, the breasts were in place in the communes. The whole body, if possible. Because it was necessary to share.

In the back seat of this patrole car, Michel knew he was condemned. Was this already the end? He 'prit conscience' that his life with Frane had been love at first sight over and over which, each time, had given a new dimension to his existence. France was an electric shock.

Her death, now, became an unsuspected blow, a bomb, explosions of earth and metal which shattered his eyes.

Immobile on the seat, he started to smile. The whole story was simply impossible. A gigantic farce, a comedy. And each one had played his role to perfection. He had all the appearances of a widower completely _sonné._ It was his turn to react: << I don't believe you. Say something funny so I can laugh. _Ça ne prend pas_. France always had the art of transforming life, she couldn't play the joke of death for god. So early. >>

_Mais ce ne fut pas encore avec ces paroles qu'il revint au présent_. As if there was steam between him and the others, as if his voice was a hand which wanted to clean a window, he said :

-- What did she die of?

The young woman responded simply :

-- Instantly. She was already deceased when the police arrived. The doctor will tell you more.

A hospital is _le terne_ of life. All that one wants to avoid, to do without. The emergency room, especially, its waiting rooms, its corridors, its sick people, this color. 

Michel saw nothing. He walked, he followed his guides. The agent _chaloupait_ a little while walking, the woman _au pas plus sec._ No one would have wanted to participate in their procession. It was sorrowful.

Why did she hear nothing but barking? Why was her head filled with howling dogs? She felt heavy, removed, she could no longer move. She didn't float, didn't sink, despite her weariness, her desire to leave. There was nothing but those dogs. A pack. In unison, they howled at the corpse. But she wasn't dead, she was stuck in an ambiguous state.

If she had wanted to speak, she would have been capable. But she had nothing to say. An oyster. She had returned to being an oyster, not happy or unhappy, solid against exterior blows.

Soon, she heard nothing but a dog. Only one. It barked, hiding itself against her breast. _Un chiot_ with soft, warm hair. A dog which, as she did in that precise instant, searched for a way to attain her life cling to or point out the course of events. The fear of the dog threaded between the cries of its mother, those of his father and his tears for her.

But Anouk said nothing, didn't move. She stayed there where they had brought her. On the white sheets, the little knocker had become a aching mass  which fluttered while the dog in her head transformed into an angry truck.

At the end of the hall, the room, finally. Before leaving Michel, the police officer showed him where France's car had been towed. He had to take care of it. Michel slipped the address into the pocket of his shirt. With a certain relief, the young officer entrusted him to a doctor, young, polite, calm, professional, in his mid-thirties.

There was much movement in the room, an orchestrated rumble, coded exchanges. Michael Laurier
